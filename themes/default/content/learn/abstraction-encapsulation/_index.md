## Time

How long this tutorial will take depends on your internet connection, reading
speed, and other factors. On average, this tutorial should take you about XXXXXX
minutes to complete.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following tools to complete this pathway:

- A [Pulumi account and
  token]({{< relref "/docs/intro/console/accounts#access-tokens" >}})
  - If you don't have an account, go to the [signup
    page](https://app.pulumi.com/signup).
- Git (version XX.XX.XX or higher)
- Go (version XX.XX.XX or higher)
- Python (version XX.XX or higher)
- .NET Core (version XX.XX.XX or higher)
- TypeScript (version XX.XX.XX or higher)

Note that the languages must be installed to generate the packages; you do not
need to know all four languages.

In addition, you should be able to
- code in either Go, Python, or TypeScript/Javascript
- 

We recommend that you either have completed [Pulumi
Fundamentals]({{< relref "/learn/pulumi-fundamentals" >}}) and [Building with
Pulumi]({{< relref "/learn/building-with-pulumi" >}}) OR have experience using
Pulumi for other projects.

## About this pathway

In this pathway, we will explore how you could use Pulumi as a tool to help you
abstract and encapsulate your resource definitions as reusable models and
packages for others to use.

Note that this pathway will not have as many code samples to use as we will be
defining patterns, exploring architecture, and discussing procedures for
Registry publication.

This pathway is considered an advanced pathway.
